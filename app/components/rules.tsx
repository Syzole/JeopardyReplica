                        <strong>Game Setup:</strong> Choose from a set of categories, each containing questions of different point values. Answer questions to earn points, but beware of random luck effects!

                    <li className="mb-2">
                        <strong>Your Turn:</strong> When a question is selected, any player can buzz in to answer. If they are incorrect, the next player who buzzed can answer, the buzzer is open until the answer is revealed.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                        <strong>Buzzer System:</strong> Players can use buzzers to signal their intent to answer.
                        The first player to buzz gets the first opportunity to respond in turn order.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                        <strong>Luck Effects:</strong> After answering, a random luck effect may occur, either helping or hindering your score.
